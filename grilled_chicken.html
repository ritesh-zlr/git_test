    <ol>
        <u><p>Step 1 Wash the chicken pieces</p></u>
        <li>
            To prepare this easy chicken recipe, wash the chicken pieces and prick them with a fork. Now, in a large
            bowl, combine hung curd, ginger paste, garlic paste, red chilli powder, coriander powder, cumin powder,
            black pepper, salt and garam masala. Stir all the ingredients together until well blended.
        </li>
        <u><p>Step 2 Grill it to perfection and serve hot!</p></u>
        <li>Now add the chicken pieces and apply the masala mixture all over them. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8
            hours or up to 24 hours. Once done, preheat the oven at 190 degree Celsius. Remove the chicken pieces from
            the marinade and place them on a grilling tray. Grill them for 1 hour, flipping them after 30 minutes so
            that both sides can cook evenly. Check if the chicken has fully cooked by taking one piece out and cutting
            it with a knife. Serve hot with salad or a dip.</li>
