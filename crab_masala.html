    <p>Crab Masala Fry is a fragrant medley of spices and aromatics. Its spicy punch is set off deliciously by the sweet
        crab meat.</p>
    <p>Toasting whole spices and aromatics in oil over low heat helps draw out fat-soluble flavor compounds and triggers
        complex reactions that improves their aroma.</p>
    <p>We cook the spiced tomato mixture until the fat breaks out into droplets on the surface. This is an indication
        that the moisture content has reduced sufficiently to intensify flavors.</p>

        <li>2 whole cloves</li>

        <li>3 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 1 tablespoon)</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro leaves</li>
        <li>Cooked rice or flatbread for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over low heat until shimmering. Add 1 tablespoon chopped
            onion, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, dried chili, peppercorns, cloves, ginger, and garlic. Cook, stirring
            frequently, until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and add fennel seeds. Stir to mix through.
            Immediately transfer to the bowl of a blender or mortar and pestle and blend/pound until a fine paste is
            formed, scraping down sides as necessary.</li></br>
        <li>Wipe out saucepan with a paper towel and add remaining oil. Heat over medium heat until shimmering. Add the
            remaining onion. Cook, stirring, unti lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Add the tomato puree, bring to a
            simmer, and simmer for 5 minutes. Add turmeric powder and the ground spice paste. Stir well to combine and
            continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the oil separates and starts surfacing. Add a few drops of
            water if the paste tends to stick or get too dry.</li></br>
        <li>Add the crab and salt. Spoon some of the sauce over the crab to coat. Cover and cook for 5 minute. Remove
            lid, stir, and continue to cook for 10 minutes, spooning the sauce over the crabs occasionally. Sprinkle
            with coriander leaves and serve immediately with rice or bread.</li></br>
    </ol>
