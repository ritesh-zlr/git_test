        <p>
            Today I am sharing her version of Paradise Style Hyderabadi Mutton Biryani. Every biryani has its unique
            recipe; some add tomatoes to it, some add onion-whole spice paste and my son’s favourite version is made
            with
            pre-cooked basmati rice, fried onions and marinated Mutton. This biryani is cooked by dum style where the
            Mutton and rice are let to cook together by placing an airtight lid to the vessel.
        </p>
        <p>This is one of the easiest recipe ever. Instead of using fried onions, you can use a convection microwave or
            an
            air fryer to heat the onions for 20-30 minutes until they caramelized. This saves a lot of calories and oil.
            I
            will marinate the Mutton with whole spices, yogurt and spice powders in the morning and cook the biryani for
            lunch. My son loves it as it is not spicy and we love it as it is packed with flavor. My achi’s paradise
            Mutton
            biryani recipe warms my heart and can brighten up any day. I made some last weekend to share with you today.

        <h6>INSTRUCTIONS</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak basmati rice in enough water for 2 hours. In a large bottomed cooking vessel, add enough water to
                cook the rice. Bring it to a boil. Add the soaked rice, olive oil, whole spices and cook until 3/4 th
                done . It will take about 8 minutes. Switch off the flame and strain the water. Set the pre-cooked rice
                aside.</li>
            <li>Marinate the Mutton with the ingredients listed under “chicken marinade” for 3-4 hours.Set them aside.</li>
            <li>Slice the onions finely thin (you can use a vegetable chopper), sprinkle oil and cook in the microwave
                for 20-30 minutes, until the brown and caramelize well.</li>
            <li>Using a 5 litre pressure cooker or any large vessel, arrange the marinated chicken as a single layer.

            <li>Mix turmeric powder with milk and sprinkle it over the rice.</li>
            <li>Cover the vessel with layers of aluminum foil. I did three layer. Seal them tight along the edges and
                place a cast iron pan on top.</li>
            <li>Cook on medium low flame for 45 minutes. Switch off the flame and let it rest for 15 minutes.</li>
